# Example Video Player

Based on [custom-html5-video](https://github.com/Freshman-tech/custom-html5-video), with modifications to support fetching video from QDN.

There are two approaches demonstrated here. One loads video via a URL, and another fetches the video content and passes it to the player as a base64 blob.

Using the base64 approach allows for more features, such as seeking.
